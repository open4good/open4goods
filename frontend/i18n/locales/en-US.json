              "answer": "<p>An ISBN is assigned by a national ISBN agency in each country, responsible for distributing and registering ISBN numbers. Publishers or authors contact this agency to obtain an ISBN for their book. When applying, they provide information about the work, such as the title, author, format and edition. Once assigned, the ISBN is unique to that edition and cannot be reused for another. This ensures efficient management of books in library, sales and distribution systems. It is essential for any work intended for wide circulation or sale.</p>",

            "difference": {
              "answer": "<p>ISBN-10 was the original format used until 2007 and consisted of 10 digits. To align with the global EAN-13 barcode standards, the system moved to a 13-digit format: ISBN-13. This change standardised sales and distribution processes worldwide because ISBN-13 codes are compatible with commercial barcode systems used across industries. While ISBN-10 codes still exist for older works, new books published since 2007 exclusively use ISBN-13, which provides greater capacity for future identifiers.</p>",

            "importance": {
              "answer": "<p>An ISBN is important because it provides a unique, standardised identifier for a book within management, sales and distribution systems. Without an ISBN, a book can be difficult to find in online catalogues or bookshops because distribution systems rely heavily on this identifier. ISBNs also facilitate indexing in library and bookstore databases, improving visibility and accessibility for readers. They are essential for a book to be widely distributed, whether in print or digital format.</p>",

              "answer": "<p>ISBN stands for <strong>“International Standard Book Number”</strong>, a standardised international number for books. It uniquely identifies a publication worldwide and simplifies the management of books in storage, distribution and sales systems. The ISBN system is used in many countries and is managed by national agencies. Each ISBN is assigned to a specific title and edition, preventing any confusion between different editions or formats of the same work (for example, between a hardback and a paperback edition).</p>",

              "answer": "<p>Sometimes an ISBN is used to identify something other than a book. Several situations can lead to this:</p><ul><li><strong>Lack of understanding of standards</strong>: Some sellers or platforms use the ISBN as a generic identifier, especially when the product is cultural or related to creative hobbies.</li><li><strong>Cost savings</strong>: In certain cases it is cheaper for a small manufacturer to reuse an existing ISBN code, even though it falls outside the standards.</li><li><strong>Code format confusion</strong>: Some marketplaces do not strictly validate standard codes and accept ISBNs for non-book products, which creates ambiguities.</li><li><strong>Reassignment or attribution error</strong>: ISBNs are sometimes used incorrectly for non-editorial products, especially when the manufacturer or distributor does not have an appropriate GTIN barcode.</li></ul>",

            "structure": {
              "answer": "<p>An ISBN consists of 13 digits (or 10 in the former system) split into five segments. These segments include: a prefix (identifying the numbering system), a registration group (representing the country or language area), a publisher number, a title number (identifying a specific work) and a check digit that validates the structure of the ISBN. This structure allows rapid and accurate identification of books, simplifying their management worldwide. The move to ISBN-13 in 2007 aligned the system with global barcode standards, making book distribution even more efficient across retail and library networks.</p>",

They can be reused, modified and redistributed by anyone for personal or professional purposes. The goal is to maximise access to information in order to encourage transparency, innovation and efficiency across sectors. Open data is often provided by public organisations, but some private companies have also started to publish portions of their data. A key aspect of open data is technical accessibility: data must be available in standard, machine-readable formats (such as CSV, JSON or XML) so they can be reused without major technical hurdles. By easing access to data, open data unlocks numerous applications, from mobile apps and visualisations to in-depth analyses.</p>",

By making data accessible, it helps citizens better understand government decisions and participate in public debate with informed arguments. Companies can use these data to develop new products and services, stimulating economic growth. Open data also supports better decision-making because public information can be analysed to improve policies, reduce inefficiencies and make institutions more accountable. Finally, open data fosters collaboration between stakeholders—researchers, entrepreneurs, developers and local communities—who can work together to solve shared challenges creatively.</p>",
