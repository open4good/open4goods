It is essential for publishers, booksellers, libraries and any platform selling books. ISBNs make it easier to manage inventory, distribution and sales. Each book or edition of the same book has its own ISBN, ensuring unique identification in databases and catalogues. ISBNs are used for both printed books and e-books, helping readers find the exact title they need in library systems and online marketplaces.</p>"

              "answer": "<p>ISBN stands for <strong>“International Standard Book Number”</strong>, a standardised international number for books. It uniquely identifies a publication worldwide and simplifies the management of books in storage, distribution and sales systems. The ISBN system is used in many countries and is managed by national agencies. Each ISBN is assigned to a specific title and edition, preventing any confusion between different editions or formats of the same work (for example, between a hardback and a paperback edition).</p>"

            "structure": {
              "question": "How is an ISBN structured?",
              "answer": "<p>An ISBN consists of 13 digits (or 10 in the former system) split into five segments. These segments include: a prefix (identifying the numbering system), a registration group (representing the country or language area), a publisher number, a title number (identifying a specific work) and a check digit that validates the structure of the ISBN. This structure allows rapid and accurate identification of books, simplifying their management worldwide. The move to ISBN-13 in 2007 aligned the system with global barcode standards, making book distribution even more efficient across retail and library networks.</p>"

              "question": "What is the difference between ISBN-10 and ISBN-13?",
              "answer": "<p>ISBN-10 was the original format used until 2007 and consisted of 10 digits. To align with the global EAN-13 barcode standards, the system moved to a 13-digit format: ISBN-13. This change standardised sales and distribution processes worldwide because ISBN-13 codes are compatible with commercial barcode systems used across industries. While ISBN-10 codes still exist for older works, new books published since 2007 exclusively use ISBN-13, which provides greater capacity for future identifiers.</p>"
            },
            "assignment": {
              "question": "How is an ISBN assigned to a book?",
              "answer": "<p>An ISBN is assigned by a national ISBN agency in each country, responsible for distributing and registering ISBN numbers. Publishers or authors contact this agency to obtain an ISBN for their book. When applying, they provide information about the work, such as the title, author, format and edition. Once assigned, the ISBN is unique to that edition and cannot be reused for another. This ensures efficient management of books in library, sales and distribution systems. It is essential for any work intended for wide circulation or sale.</p>"

            "importance": {
              "question": "Why are ISBNs important?",
              "answer": "<p>An ISBN is important because it provides a unique, standardised identifier for a book within management, sales and distribution systems. Without an ISBN, a book can be difficult to find in online catalogues or bookshops because distribution systems rely heavily on this identifier. ISBNs also facilitate indexing in library and bookstore databases, improving visibility and accessibility for readers. They are essential for a book to be widely distributed, whether in print or digital format.</p>"

              "answer": "<p>Sometimes an ISBN is used to identify something other than a book. Several situations can lead to this:</p><ul><li><strong>Lack of understanding of standards</strong>: Some sellers or platforms use the ISBN as a generic identifier, especially when the product is cultural or related to creative hobbies.</li><li><strong>Cost savings</strong>: In certain cases it is cheaper for a small manufacturer to reuse an existing ISBN code, even though it falls outside the standards.</li><li><strong>Code format confusion</strong>: Some marketplaces do not strictly validate standard codes and accept ISBNs for non-book products, which creates ambiguities.</li><li><strong>Reassignment or attribution error</strong>: ISBNs are sometimes used incorrectly for non-editorial products, especially when the manufacturer or distributor does not have an appropriate GTIN barcode.</li></ul>"

          "question": "Where do the datasets come from?",
          "answer": "<p>Extractions provided by Nudger stem from our work aggregating product data. We integrate a wide variety of sources that we group into several categories:</p><p><strong>Brand and manufacturer websites:</strong><br>We extract data directly from product sheets made available by brands and manufacturers.</p><p><strong>Institutional websites and open data:</strong> (base eprel, open food facts)<br>We integrate data from public or open repositories.</p><p><strong>Affiliate feeds and marketplaces:</strong> (awin, effinity, affilae, amazon, ..)<br>These come from promotional partnerships between Nudger and the platforms. We include a link in our extract so affiliate tracking applies when active offers exist for the product.</p><p>Nudger aggregates, normalises and resolves conflicts to publish factual, minimal product data. Building and sharing this database follows a commons mindset. We are convinced that sharing these datasets benefits every stakeholder in the consumption chain (manufacturers, retailers, researchers, citizens).</p><p>We are also mindful of intellectual property. Feel free to <a href=\"/contact\">contact us</a> with any question or if, as a data holder, you wish to opt out of this dataset.</p>"

        "definition": {
          "question": "What do we mean by open data?",
          "answer": "<p>Open data refers to data that is made accessible to everyone without access restrictions and in formats that can be freely reused. They can be reused, modified and redistributed by anyone for personal or professional purposes. The goal is to maximise access to information in order to encourage transparency, innovation and efficiency across sectors. Open data is often provided by public organisations, but some private companies have also started to publish portions of their data. A key aspect of open data is technical accessibility: data must be available in standard, machine-readable formats (such as CSV, JSON or XML) so they can be reused without major technical hurdles. By easing access to data, open data unlocks numerous applications, from mobile apps and visualisations to in-depth analyses.</p>"
        },
        "importance": {
          "question": "Why is open data important for commerce?",
          "answer": "<p>Open data is crucial for promoting transparency and innovation. By making data accessible, it helps citizens better understand government decisions and participate in public debate with informed arguments. Companies can use these data to develop new products and services, stimulating economic growth. Open data also supports better decision-making because public information can be analysed to improve policies, reduce inefficiencies and make institutions more accountable. Finally, open data fosters collaboration between stakeholders—researchers, entrepreneurs, developers and local communities—who can work together to solve shared challenges creatively.</p>"
        },
        "contributors": {
          "question": "How can contributors help improve the datasets?",
          "answer": "<p>Nudger aggregates, normalises and resolves conflicts to publish factual product data, but contributions remain essential. You can share additional sources, report issues in the datasets or suggest improvements. Collaborating with manufacturers, distributors, researchers and citizens helps us keep the exports accurate, up to date and useful for everyone.</p>"
