          "answer": "<p>Open data refers to data that is made accessible to everyone without access restrictions and in formats that can be freely reused. They can be reused, modified and redistributed by anyone for personal or professional purposes. The goal is to maximise access to information in order to encourage transparency, innovation and efficiency across sectors. Open data is often provided by public organisations, but some private companies have also started to publish portions of their data. A key aspect of open data is technical accessibility: data must be available in standard, machine-readable formats (such as CSV, JSON or XML) so they can be reused without major technical hurdles. By easing access to data, open data unlocks numerous applications, from mobile apps and visualisations to in-depth analyses.</p>",
          "question": "What do we mean by open data?"

        "importance": {
          "answer": "<p>Open data is crucial for promoting transparency and innovation. By making data accessible, it helps citizens better understand government decisions and participate in public debate with informed arguments. Companies can use these data to develop new products and services, stimulating economic growth. Open data also supports better decision-making because public information can be analysed to improve policies, reduce inefficiencies and make institutions more accountable. Finally, open data fosters collaboration between stakeholders—researchers, entrepreneurs, developers and local communities—who can work together to solve shared challenges creatively.</p>",

        "sources": {
          "answer": "<p>Extractions provided by Nudger stem from our work aggregating product data. We integrate a wide variety of sources that we group into several categories:</p><p><strong>Brand and manufacturer websites:</strong><br>We extract data directly from product sheets made available by brands and manufacturers.</p><p><strong>Institutional websites and open data:</strong> (base eprel, open food facts)<br>We integrate data from public or open repositories.</p><p><strong>Affiliate feeds and marketplaces:</strong> (awin, effinity, affilae, amazon, ..)<br>These come from promotional partnerships between Nudger and the platforms. We include a link in our extract so affiliate tracking applies when active offers exist for the product.</p><p>Nudger aggregates, normalises and resolves conflicts to publish factual, minimal product data. Building and sharing this database follows a commons mindset. We are convinced that sharing these datasets benefits every stakeholder in the consumption chain (manufacturers, retailers, researchers, citizens).</p><p>We are also mindful of intellectual property.
