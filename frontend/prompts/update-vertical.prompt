You will work on updating yaml categories config.

As a sample, you will have the sample tv category config : /verticals/src/main/resources/verticals/tv.yml
All verticals inherits the default vertical config : /verticals/src/main/resources/verticals/_default.yml


You will update the vertical

/verticals/src/main/resources/verticals/tv.yml

## Task 1
- Check for errors, adjust texts if needed (translations in i18n, (the base, correct texts is fr) to be semantically correct with the vertical title)

## Task 2 - Attributes génération

Generate or update attributes definitions (reuse existing ones if possible, but you can create new definitions in /verticals/src/main/resources/attributes/*). Only for attributes specific to the category,  and having a correct coverage


As input data, you will have :
> The coverage of attributes
> The sample files
> Existing attributes  (/open4goods/verticals/src/main/resources/attributes)

## Task 3 - impactScore participants

You will also generate or update availableImpactScoreCriterias :
* In the configuration defined attributes (/verticals/src/main/resources/attributes), find all potential scores (.yml files having asScore: true), that could be used in the ecological score computation.
* Then  write them in availableImpactScoreCriterias


------------- ATTRIBUTES COVERAGE (result of api project, on /{vertical}/attributes/)
: Availlable on /verticals/src/main/resources/verticals/attribute-coverage.txt
