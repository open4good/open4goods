### Feature Description  
*Describe the feature or enhancement you would like to see.*  
<!-- Example: "Add an option to compare more than two items at once." -->

### Why Is This Needed?  
*Explain the problem or use case that this feature addresses. What frustration or gap does it fill?*  
<!-- Example: "Currently users can only compare two products. Allowing more would let them evaluate multiple options side-by-side." -->

### Proposed Solution  
*Describe how you imagine this feature being implemented. Include details on the approach, UI/UX changes, or data models if applicable.*  
<!-- Example: "Introduce a dynamic list component where users can add multiple products, and update the comparison logic to handle an arbitrary number of items." -->

### Alternatives Considered  
*If applicable, mention any alternative solutions or workarounds you have considered.*  
<!-- Example: "Users could run multiple comparisons in parallel, but that is cumbersome. A single comparison of multiple items would be more user-friendly." -->

### Additional Context  
*Add any other context, screenshots, or links about the feature request here.*  
<!-- If there are design mockups, documentation, or discussions related to this feature, link them here. -->
