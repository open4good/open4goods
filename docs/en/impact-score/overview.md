## Key ideas

- **Normalized scale** from 0 to 5.
- **Transparent weighting** based on category-specific importance.
- **Data quality penalties** to highlight missing product information.

## Where the score appears

You will see the Impact Score on product pages, category pages, and the public
methodology section. For a deeper breakdown, browse the related docs.
