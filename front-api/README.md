# Nudger Front API

This module provides the REST endpoints used by the Nuxt 3 frontend. It exposes data aggregated by other open4goods modules and is secured with JWT tokens.
The former `/api/v1/search` endpoint was removed from this module.
Use the main `api` service for search operations.

## Default Port

The application runs on **port 8082** by default (`server.port` in `application.yml`). This keeps it separate from the main API on port 8081.

## Security

Security is enabled by default using JWT authentication. For local testing it can be disabled by setting
`front.security.enabled=false` in `application.yml` or via an environment variable.

## Building

mvn clean install
```

Or build from the repository root:
